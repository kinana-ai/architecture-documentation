# Compliance & Governance - Overview

## Purpose

This section provides guidance on compliance requirements and governance frameworks for the Kinana Content Hub platform. It references existing policies and procedures maintained in the YHT corporate SharePoint repository.

---

## Compliance Framework

Kinana operates within multiple regulatory jurisdictions and must comply with:

- **UAE**: Personal Data Protection Law (PDPL)
- **Egypt**: Law 151/2020 (Data Protection)
- **International**: GDPR (for potential EU users)
- **Educational**: Ministry of Education standards (UAE, Egypt)
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- **Localization**: Arabic language and RTL requirements

---

## IP Governance Framework

**Location**: YHT Corporate SharePoint - PMO Records  
**Access**: All development team members  
**Maintenance**: Product Manager + IP Governance Committee

### IP Strategy

Kinana's IP protection approach:

- **Trademarks**: Primary protection mechanism for brand and platform names
- **Trade Secrets**: Core protection for proprietary algorithms, processes, and implementations
- **Patents**: Not pursued (difficult to defend novel approaches in software)
- **Copyright**: Automatic protection for original code and content

**Rationale**: Trade secrets and trademarks provide more practical and cost-effective protection for educational technology platforms than patents.

### SharePoint Repository Structure

**PMO - Records - All Documents**

All IP governance documentation is maintained in the corporate SharePoint site with the following structure:
