## Step 5: Working with Robotics Kits

### Connecting Your Kit

**Hardware Setup**

1. Ensure your robotics kit is powered on
2. Connect to your computer via USB or Bluetooth (kit-dependent)
3. Open Brokkly and select **Connect Hardware**
4. Choose your kit type from the list
5. Follow on-screen connection instructions
6. Wait for connection confirmation

**Testing Your Connection**  
Run a simple test program to verify your hardware is responding correctly.

### Programming Your Kit

1. Select appropriate code blocks for your hardware
2. Build your program logic on the canvas
3. Click **Upload to Device** or **Run** to execute
4. Observe your kit's behavior
5. Iterate and refine your code as needed

## Step 6: Exploring the Activities Library

### What are Activities?

Activities are pre-built coding projects and lessons designed to teach programming concepts and hardware interaction progressively.

### Using Activities

1. Navigate to **Activities** within Brokkly
2. Browse by difficulty level, kit type, or learning objective
3. Select an activity to view details and requirements
4. Click **Start Activity** to load it into your workspace
5. Follow the included instructions and challenges
6. Modify and experiment with the provided code

### Activity Categories

- **Beginner** - Basic concepts and simple programs
- **Intermediate** - Multi-step projects and sensor integration
- **Advanced** - Complex robotics behaviors and algorithms
- **Challenges** - Open-ended problems to solve creatively
