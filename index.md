# <span translate="no">Kinana Documentation</span>

**Kinana** is an online **content hub** designed to bring together all kinds of learning and creative materials in one place.
Users can upload and manage **documents**, **videos**, **audio files**, and **coding activities** — all of which run across Kinana’s microservice-based apps:

- **Library** – for reading and exploring documents and articles.
- **Videos** – for watching educational or creative video content.
- **Podcast** – for listening to audio and podcast episodes.
- **Brokkly** – for running interactive coding activities.

Kinana is built as a **modular, microservice platform**, making it easy to extend, scale, and integrate with other systems.
